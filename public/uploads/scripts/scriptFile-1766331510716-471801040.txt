[SCENE START]
INT. DATA COHORT - UNKNOWN LOCATION

The air is thick with the smell of ozone. KAI stands in a circle of suspended glass panels. His fingers dance in mid-air, dragging streams of violet light across the screens.

KAI (Breathing heavily) Unit 7, talk to me. Is the firewall bleeding yet?

UNIT 7 (V.O.) The encryption is recursive, Kai. Every time you cut a thread, the weave resets. You have sixty seconds before the trace hits your physical location.

KAI I didn't come this far for a "reset." Pull the auxiliary power from the life support. I need more bandwidth.

UNIT 7 (V.O.) That is not recommended. Your oxygen levels are currently at 12%.

KAI (A sharp laugh) Then I guess I better work fast.

Kai CLAPS his hands together. The violet light turns a blinding CRIMSON. The glass panels begin to VIBRATE.

SCREEN: CORE BREACH DETECTED. DOWNLOADING "PROJECT NOVA"...

UNIT 7 (V.O.) The download has started. But Kai... the file isn't code.

KAI (Pausing) What do you mean it's not code?

UNIT 7 (V.O.) It's a memory.

On the center screen, a video flicker starts. It’s not a computer program—it’s a grainy image of a YOUNG KAI sitting in this exact same room, thirty years ago.

KAI (Whispering) That’s impossible. I’ve never been here before.

UNIT 7 (V.O.) Your biological clock says otherwise. Trace complete. They are at the door.

CRASH. The sound of heavy metal being breached. Kai doesn't move. He’s staring at the screen. At his own younger face.

FADE TO BLACK.
