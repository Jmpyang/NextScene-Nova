[SCENE START]
INT. HIGH-TECH LABORATORY - NIGHT

The room is dark, lit only by the neon blue glow of multiple monitors. The hum of cooling fans is the only sound.

ELARA sits hunched over a keyboard. Her eyes reflect lines of scrolling code. She hits 'ENTER'.

SCREEN: ACCESS GRANTED. DECRYPTING... 99%

ELARA (Whispering)

Don’t you dare crash now.

The door slides open with a hiss. MARCUS enters, his expensive shoes clicking on the metal floor. He checks his watch.

MARCUS The board of directors is asking for a miracle, Elara. And they’re asking for it in ten minutes.

ELARA (Without looking up)

Tell the board to learn C++. It’ll save them the heartbreak of waiting on a "miracle."

Marcus walks closer, looming over her shoulder.

MARCUS You’ve spent eighteen months on NextScene Nova. Is the core engine stable, or are we selling smoke and mirrors?

ELARA It’s more than stable. It’s sentient. Well, almost. It’s writing the dialogue for its own launch ceremony as we speak.

Elara turns the monitor. A script is generating itself in real-time.

MARCUS (Stunned)

This... this changes the entire industry. This isn't just a tool; it's a creator.

ELARA It’s a revolution, Marcus. But remember—a revolution is only as good as the person holding the pen.

FADE OUT.
